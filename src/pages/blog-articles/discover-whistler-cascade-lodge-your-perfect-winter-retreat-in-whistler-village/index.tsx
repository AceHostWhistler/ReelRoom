              <h2>The Winter Whistler Experience from Ace Cascade Lodge</h2>
              <p>
                Imagine starting your day with a cup of coffee on your private balcony as the sun illuminates the snow-covered peaks. After a hearty breakfast prepared in your kitchenette, you grab your warm boots from the boot room, collect your equipment from storage, and make the short walk to the gondola.
              </p>

              <p>
                After an exhilarating day on the slopes, perhaps you'll unwind in our hot tub before strolling along the Village Stroll to one of Whistler's renowned restaurants for dinner. Or maybe you'll prefer to pick up groceries from the nearby market and enjoy a cozy meal in your suite while watching the snow gently falling outside your window.
