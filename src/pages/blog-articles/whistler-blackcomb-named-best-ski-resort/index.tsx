              <p>From gentle slopes perfect for beginners to heart-pounding steeps, cliffs, and chutes for the most advanced skiers, there's something for everyone across the two magnificent mountains. Add to this an impressive 1,609 meters of vertical terrain, 16 alpine bowls, and three glaciers, and you have a skiing paradise that keeps visitors coming back year after year.</p>
              
              <p>Beyond the exceptional terrain, visitors benefit from:</p>
              
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Modern infrastructure:</strong> An efficient network of 26 lifts, including the engineering marvel that is the PEAK 2 PEAK Gondola connecting both mountains</li>
                <li><strong>Reliable snow conditions:</strong> An average annual snowfall of 11.7 meters (38.4 feet)</li>
                <li><strong>World-class terrain parks:</strong> Five innovative parks with features for all skill levels</li>
                <li><strong>Extensive backcountry access:</strong> Opportunities for guided adventures beyond the resort boundaries</li>

              <h2>The Whistler Village Experience</h2>
              
              <p>
                While the mountains themselves are spectacular, a significant part of Whistler's charm is the pedestrian-only village that sits at their base. Whistler Village offers a European-inspired alpine atmosphere with cobblestone walkways, charming architecture, and an incredible selection of dining, shopping, and entertainment options.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                "From the moment you arrive in Whistler Village, nestled at the base of Whistler and Blackcomb mountains, it's apparent that this is a resort village unlike any other you've ever experienced." — Whistler Tourism
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>
                After a day on the slopes, you can explore over 200 retail shops, indulge in world-class dining at more than 90 restaurants and bars, or simply relax in one of the many spas. The vibrant après-ski scene at establishments like the Garibaldi Lift Company (GLC) — consistently ranked as North America's #1 après-ski bar — provides the perfect ending to an exhilarating day on the mountain.
              </p>
