              <ul>
                <li>A massive 5,020 ft (1,530 m) vertical drop – among the largest in North America</li>

              <h2>Tips for Planning Your Activities</h2>
              <p>
                To make the most of your Whistler adventure while staying at Ace Cascade Lodge:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Book in advance:</strong> Popular activities like heli-skiing, certain dining experiences, and spa treatments often sell out, especially during peak seasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consider multi-day passes:</strong> For skiing or bike park access, multi-day passes offer better value than single-day tickets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Ask our concierge:</strong> Our knowledgeable staff can provide recommendations, booking assistance, and insider tips to enhance your experience.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Check seasonal timing:</strong> Some activities have specific seasonal openings, so verify availability during your planned visit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Bundle experiences:</strong> Some activity providers offer discounted packages when booking multiple adventures.
                </li>
              </ul>
